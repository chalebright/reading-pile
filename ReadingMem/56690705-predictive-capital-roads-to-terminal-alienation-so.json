Industrialisation intensified this relation, as production grew increasingly dependent on the accumulation of past labour stored in constant capital form in these tools —shifting the balance of value creation from the living to the dead.",

      "text": "Under industrial capitalism, *constant capital* referred to past labour —*dead labour*— objectified in the form of tools, machinery, and infrastructure. While it entered the production process, it did not itself generate surplus-value. Only living labour could animate this inert material —could set dead labour to work— to create new value. Yet as the means of objectifying labour evolved, so too did Capital’s capacity to store, recall, and operationalise it. What began within our early evolution with the construction of simple tools and the extraction of raw materials eventually extended into the domain of language, notation, and the symbolic compression of cognition. Driven by Capital’s imperative to extract surplus wherever possible, the development of structural apparatus for the capture and reanimation of labour has accelerated —from written language to musical notation, industrial machines to contemporary recording, and now predictive systems that claim to capture and reanimate our cognitive labour.",

Horizons of solidarity and utopia are erased by a synthetic anterograde amnesia, administered under the anaesthesia of machinic hallucination, inducing an affect of euphoric dissociation —a trip not into cosmic unity, but into the isolating loop of a machinic K-hole.",

For many their (mis)use is less laziness, than desperation in a system that continues to close off alternative routes.",
