Rather, it suggests how *a story is to be continued*. The one seeking counsel and the counsellor both belong to a narrative community. Those seeking counsel must themselves be able to *narrate*. In real life, counsel is sought and given in a narrative context. As wisdom, it is ‘woven into the fabric of real life’.[3](private://read/01kdxc3stvnwn046p4hgr49r0p/part0006_split_001.html#ft3) Wisdom is embedded in *life as narrative*. If life can no longer be narrated, wisdom deteriorates, and its place is taken by *problem-solving techniques*. Wisdom is *narrated truth*: ‘The art of storytelling is nearing its end because the epic side of truth, wisdom, is dying out.’",
