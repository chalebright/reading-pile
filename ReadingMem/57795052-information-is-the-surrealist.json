      "text": "artwork that creates no meaning but manipulates facts to transform legible to illegible but it retains the initial materiality, for example in euroids the information given is printer and its receipt paper in its visual and audible form, connecting the subconscious mundane act of consumption, grounding it to our daily lives (empathety). the work proceeds to transform this mundanity into something cosmic, implying the infinite, connecting two images in a narrow span of time allowing birth of a new image. in this transformation the mechanical structure is there to preserve the narrative tension, eradicating this transformations legibility allows it to reach a more purer version of poetry, and meaning happens posteriori.",
